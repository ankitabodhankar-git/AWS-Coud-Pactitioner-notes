## Deep Learning (DL)

Deep Learning uses **Artificial Neural Networks** that mimic the human brain. These networks contain multiple layers of artificial neurons that process information and pass it to the next layer until a final prediction or result is produced.

### Common Deep Learning Use Cases

* Computer Vision
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Speech Recognition
* Image Generation
* Recommendation Systems

---

## Generative AI

Generative AI is a type of Deep Learning that can create new content and ideas.

### Examples of Generated Content

* Conversations
* Stories
* Images
* Videos
* Music
* Code

Unlike traditional Machine Learning models that perform a single task, Generative AI models can perform multiple tasks.

---

## Foundation Models (FMs)

Generative AI is powered by very large Machine Learning models called **Foundation Models (FMs)**.

### Characteristics of Foundation Models

* Pre-trained on massive datasets
* Can perform multiple tasks
* Adaptable to different use cases
* Understand patterns from text, images, audio, and video

---

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a popular type of Foundation Model trained on vast amounts of text data.

### Examples

* ChatGPT
* Amazon Q
* Claude
* Gemini

### What LLMs Can Do

* Answer Questions
* Generate Text
* Summarize Documents
* Write Code
* Translate Languages
